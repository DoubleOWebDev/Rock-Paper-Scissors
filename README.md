# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors Project Demonstrating new knowledge of Javascript

Things I learned:
    
    1. I learned how to use the math.random function
    2. I better learned how to implement a loop and conditional statement together.
    3. I learned the process of nesting functions within other functions.
    4. I also learned that simplyifying your code makes it that much easier to build more code
Most important thing I learned:

    1. Pseudo code and a break from coding are really beneficial. 
    I understand that I don't know everything about JS BUT
    if I can write out my ideas in much smaller, bite-sized,
    chunks of information; I can reach my goal.
